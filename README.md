# Forest Cover Classification

In this project, I created a deep learning model to predict **forest cover type** based on various **cartographic variables**. I completed this project with guidance from CodeAcademy.

The possible forest cover types are:
* Spruce/fir
* Lodgepole pine
* Ponderosa pine
* Cottonwood/willow
* Aspen,
* Douglas-fir
* Krummholz

The data I will be using contains 581,012 observations of 30x30 meter cells taken in 4 wilderness areas located in Roosevelt National Forest.

The model that I developed was able to reach around 34% loss and 86% accuracy when classifying forest cells.
